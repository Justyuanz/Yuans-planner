# Yuan's Planner Rewrite — Agent Handoff

## Goal
Rewrite Yuan's Planner into a clean, understandable architecture without breaking existing behavior.

Target:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Backend: Python
- Database: SQLite
- Preserve existing features and data unless a change is explicitly documented.

## Repository Setup
Use the **existing Git repository**, not a separate unrelated repo.

Keep:
- `main` = original working Yuan's Planner
- `rewrite/react-typescript` = rewrite/migration branch

Prefer a Git worktree so both versions are available as separate folders:
- original folder → `main`
- rewrite folder → `rewrite/react-typescript`

Before migration starts:
1. Commit the current working project.
2. Create tag `pre-react-rewrite`.
3. Create branch `rewrite/react-typescript`.
4. Do all rewrite work on the rewrite branch.
5. Do not modify `main` during the migration.

The old application is the behavioral reference until the replacement is verified.

## Core Rules
1. Do not rewrite the whole project at once.
2. Understand existing behavior before replacing it.
3. Migrate one feature at a time.
4. Keep old working code until the replacement is tested.
5. Prefer simple, readable code over clever abstractions.
6. One file should have one clear responsibility.
7. Keep functions short and focused when practical.
8. Avoid duplicated logic.
9. Do not redesign features unless necessary.
10. Never remove working code until the replacement passes tests.

## Comments
Write **short, useful comments** so I can learn from the code.

Comment:
- why non-obvious code exists
- important business rules
- unusual decisions or edge cases
- sections whose purpose is not immediately clear

Do not:
- comment obvious code
- write long essay-style comments
- use comments instead of clear names and structure

Example:

```ts
// Keep completed tasks visible until the next daily reset.
const visibleTasks = ...
```

not:

```ts
// This variable stores the visible tasks.
const visibleTasks = ...
```

## Git Discipline
Git history is part of the project documentation.

At the beginning of a session, inspect:
- `git status`
- recent Git history
- current diff
- `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`

Make **frequent, small commits** after completed working steps.

Good commit boundaries:
- add tests for one behavior
- migrate one small feature
- extract one coherent module
- fix one verified bug
- remove one verified legacy implementation

Avoid giant commits containing many unrelated changes.

Before each commit:
1. Review the diff.
2. Run relevant tests.
3. Confirm the application still works for the affected feature.
4. Use a clear commit message describing what changed.

Do not intentionally commit broken code. If a session must stop mid-task, leave clear notes in this file about the unfinished state.

## Required Workflow
For every task:

1. Read this file.
2. Check Git status, recent commits, and current diff.
3. Inspect the relevant existing code.
4. Identify and document current behavior.
5. Add or update tests protecting that behavior.
6. Run the tests before changing the implementation when useful.
7. Make one reasonably small migration/refactor.
8. Run tests again.
9. Fix failures before continuing.
10. Review the diff.
11. Commit the completed working step.
12. Update this file before ending the session.

## Testing Priority
Testing is mandatory because the rewrite must preserve behavior.

Protect important user flows first:
- application starts successfully
- existing SQLite data loads correctly
- create/edit/delete operations work
- refresh/restart does not lose data
- major pages render correctly
- important filters, dates, forms, and interactions still behave as before

Use:
- unit tests for isolated logic where useful
- backend/API tests for Python behavior
- end-to-end tests for important UI flows

For a migrated feature:
1. Understand old behavior.
2. Create tests for the important behavior.
3. Implement the replacement.
4. Run tests.
5. Compare old and new behavior.
6. Remove legacy code only after verification.

## Migration Order

### Phase 1 — Reverse Engineering
- [x] Map project files
- [x] List existing features
- [x] Document SQLite schema
- [x] Identify frontend/backend boundaries
- [x] Identify duplicated/dead code
- [x] Identify critical user flows

### Phase 2 — Safety Net
- [ ] Add tests for critical backend behavior
- [ ] Add tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Record current expected behavior

### Phase 3 — New Structure
- [ ] Create React + TypeScript frontend beside the old frontend
- [ ] Create clean Python API structure
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend
- [ ] Confirm SQLite data still works

### Phase 4 — Feature Migration
Migrate one feature at a time.

For each feature:
- [ ] document old behavior
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] implement new version
- [ ] compare old/new behavior
- [ ] commit the working migration
- [ ] remove legacy implementation only after tests pass

## Current Task
Phase 1 reverse engineering is complete. No production rewrite code has been started.

## Last Completed Task
Created `docs/reverse-engineering.md`, covering the runtime architecture, file and feature maps, HTTP API, SQLite/key/value and domain data shapes, cross-feature coupling, legacy data, duplication/dead code, current test gaps, and critical user flows.

## Next Task
Begin Phase 2 by adding compatibility fixtures and tests for storage hydration/persistence, then protect event-to-task synchronization before introducing React or changing production behavior.

## Important Decisions
- Use the same Git repository.
- Keep `main` as the original working application.
- Perform migration on `rewrite/react-typescript`.
- Prefer a separate Git worktree for the rewrite branch.
- Existing application is the behavioral reference.
- SQLite is preserved initially.
- Python backend is preserved initially.
- Frontend will migrate to React + TypeScript.
- Large rewrites in one step are prohibited.
- Readability and learnability are priorities.
- Use short explanatory comments for non-obvious code.
- Treat every existing `hivePlanner.*` value as a compatibility contract; preserve unknown keys and unknown record fields until a tested migration explicitly handles them.
- Preserve server-first hydration with local-storage backfill unless a separately documented migration changes it.
- Keep task timers persistent, but keep current Skate and Guitar session start times transient across refresh.
- The first React boundary should be read-only and use typed compatibility decoders against the existing `/api/kv` response.

## Known Problems
- Existing project is over 20,000 lines.
- Some files contain thousands of lines.
- Duplicate/redundant functions likely exist.
- Current architecture is difficult to understand.
- `frontend/js/app.js` is 8,354 lines and owns storage, normalization, rendering, event handling, and cross-feature orchestration without direct automated coverage.
- `frontend/css/styles.css` is 5,631 lines with several accumulated responsive sections.
- Time/date parsing and normalization are duplicated across frontend modules and backend integrations.
- Several declared storage keys and an older Study/Body weekly-overview path are inactive, while the real database still contains legacy-only keys that backups must preserve.
- Browser inspection reports 29 generated form controls without an `id` or `name`.
- The default `node` on the inspected machine is Node 14 and cannot run `node --test`; use the installed modern Node runtime or fix the local PATH before relying on `scripts/test.sh` without `NODE_BIN`.
- Most cross-feature behavior in `app.js` has no DOM or end-to-end tests yet.

## Session Log

### Session 1

- Confirmed the rewrite worktree is clean and on `rewrite/react-typescript`; `main` remains in the original worktree at tag `pre-react-rewrite`.
- Read the repository instructions and handoff, then inspected recent history, the current diff, the tracked source/test inventory, relevant implementations and tests, and existing design notes.
- Inspected the existing `main` SQLite schema and field shapes without copying personal content.
- Ran the app against an empty temporary database and verified all six views at desktop and mobile widths. All 19 initial network requests succeeded; no horizontal overflow was present. Chrome reported one existing form-control issue affecting 29 generated fields.
- Added `docs/reverse-engineering.md` as the Phase 1 source of truth.
- Verification: 17 Python tests and 94 JavaScript tests pass using `/Users/yuan/.nvm/versions/node/v24.14.1/bin/node`. The default Node 14 binary is too old for the test runner.
- No production files were changed.

## Before Ending Any Session
Always:
1. Run relevant tests.
2. Review `git diff` and `git status`.
3. Commit completed working changes.
4. Update:
   - Current Task
   - Last Completed Task
   - Next Task
   - Important Decisions
   - Known Problems
   - Session Log

The next agent session must be able to continue using only:
- the repository
- this file
- Git history
- tests
- relevant source files

Do not depend on previous chat history.
